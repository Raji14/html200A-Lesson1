        <h3>What is responsive web design?</h3>
        <p>In the past, as more devices started to flood the market, more than one site was built to accommodate the different screen sizes. Responsive web design addresses this issue by creating a single site that automatically reacts to the size of a user’s device—with one URL and one content source. A responsive website has a fluid and flexible layout which adjusts according to the different screen sizes, thereby offering an optimized browsing experience.</p>
        <h3>Seamless user experience</h3>
        <p>One of the primary benefits of a responsive website is having a responsive and seamless user experience across devices. Websites that are not responsive usually distort the appearance of text and images on mobile devices and is not a good user experience.</p>
        <h3>Lower Cost and website maintenance</h3>
        <p>One of the other benefit of a responsive website is it offers a much lower maintenance cost as compared to maintaining multiple versions of one site. Even though the initial cost of setting up a responsive website may be high, eventually the reduced cost of maintaining multiple websites will add up.</p>
        <h3>Improves your SEO efforts</h3>
        <p>Google recommends a responsive web design and so offers these sites a greater likelihood of ranking high in the search engine results pages.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, a responsive web design will save you money, maintenance time and also retain your users in the long run! </p>
